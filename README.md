=======================

Simple utility which lets you run just specific gherkin step.

## Why?

```
Scenario: Developer should have ability to write E2E tests which involves backend more easy
Given i have mobile application
   Or i have single page application
  And i want to run E2E tests
When i have scenarios with some preconditions
 And this preconditions should be prepared on backend
Then i need to mock API
  Or write CLI scripts for preparing fixtures
 But server already have an implementation for all needed steps
 And there is no need for duplicate stuff
```
